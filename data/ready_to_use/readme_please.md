## Read me first!

Data are stored the *data_prep* repo under *data/outputs/*

Data here have been QC'ed to either level 1 (L1) or level 2 (L2). These levels are defined below, and not interoperable with other projects' definitions

L1 means the data have been cleaned algorithmically (no manual cleaning) based on MCRLdata flags and potentially additional processes

L2 means the data have undergone additional QC. Many L1 datasets are not available as L2.

DATA COME WITH NO GUARANTEE THEY ARE CORRECT. ENSURING DATA QUALITY IS SUFFICIENT FOR YOUR USE IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY!
